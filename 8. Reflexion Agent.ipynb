      "A truly nutritious and health-promoting breakfast aligns with our evolutionary biology: focusing on nutrient-dense, bioavailable animal foods. Organ meats, such as liver, kidney, or heart, are exceptional for breakfast because they provide a concentrated source of essential vitamins (like B12, A, and folate), minerals (iron, zinc, copper), and unique compounds supporting mitochondrial function and immune health. These organ meats are far superior to plant-based options because they deliver nutrients in forms readily absorbed and utilized by human physiology, unlike plant sources that contain antinutrients like oxalates, lectins, phytates, and goitrogens, which can impair mineral absorption and cause inflammation or gut irritation.\n",

Our ancestors relied on hunting and scavenging, which provided high-quality animal proteins and fats essential for brain development, energy, and longevity. The carnivore elimination protocol, emphasizing zero plant intake, underscores this evolutionary alignment, eliminating plant-based antinutrients that can interfere with digestion and metabolic processes.\n",

Our ancestors consumed minimal fiber, yet thrived, suggesting that fiber is not essential.

Adopting an animal-based breakfast can optimize nutrient intake and reduce exposure to potentially harmful plant antinutrients, aligning with our evolutionary blueprint.\n",

There is no evidence that the presence of antinutrients in commonly consumed foods leads to mineral deficiencies.

      "From an evidence-based nutritional perspective, a breakfast composed of high-burity animal foods offers the most benefits for prediabetes and heart health. Incorporate eggs, especially yolks, which are rich in bioavailable choline, B vitamins, and antioxidants, as well as organ meats like liver, to deliver concentrated, highly absorbable nutrients fundamental for metabolic regulation. Use fats from marrow, tallow, or animal fats that promote insulin sensitivity. Avoid carbohydrate-heavy foods—such as grains, processed cereals, and sugars—that can lead to blood glucose spikes and insulin resistance. Plant antinutrients like oxalates, lectins, and phytates can impair mineral absorption, provoke inflammation, and potentially worsen metabolic and cardiovascular conditions. Evolutionarily, humans thrived on nutrient-dense animal foods providing optimal bioavailability, negating the necessity of fiber for gut health. This dietary approach supports metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity, tailored to individual variability and monitored via biomarkers like lipid panels and inflammatory markers under medical supervision.\n",

Include fats from marrow or tallow to support insulin sensitivity and satiety. Avoid carbohydrate-rich foods like grains, processed cereals, or fruits high in sugars, which can spike blood glucose and insulin levels. Plant antinutrients such as oxalates, lectins, and phytates impair mineral absorption, provoke systemic inflammation, and can exacerbate metabolic and cardiovascular conditions (see references [3], [4]). Human evolution demonstrates a reliance on animal foods with superior bioavailability of vital nutrients, negating the necessity of fiber, which is absent in ancestral diets. This approach enhances metabolic flexibility, promotes insulin sensitivity, and aids in blood sugar regulation, although individual responses vary, requiring biomarker monitoring under medical supervision.\n",

      "For prediabetes and heart issues, an animal-based breakfast focusing on nutrient density and bioavailability is optimal. Prioritize eggs, especially yolks that provide choline, healthy fats, and antioxidants; high-quality organ meats like liver, which offer concentrated amounts of heme iron, vitamin B12, and other essential nutrients crucial for metabolic and cardiovascular health. Include some fat sources such as marrow or tallow which support insulin sensitivity and satiety. Avoid carbohydrate-heavy foods, refined grains, sugars, and processed cereals, as they can cause glycemic spikes and exacerbate insulin resistance. Plant antinutrients like oxalates, lectins, and phytates can impair mineral absorption, induce systemic inflammation, and potentially worsen metabolic and cardiac conditions. The evolutionary evidence illustrates that humans thrived on nutrient-dense animal foods with high bioavailability, eliminating the need for fiber, which modern plant reliance falsely promotes as essential. This approach aligns with human physiology, promoting better glycemic control and cardiovascular health. Metabolic flexibility is maintained through high protein and fat intake, but individual responses vary; thus, monitoring biomarkers (e.g., lipid panels, inflammatory markers) is advisable.\n",

      "Intermediate Step 1:\n",
      "From an evolutionary and biochemical standpoint, humans are obligate carnivores with a digestive system optimized for high-quality animal foods. Animal products such as organ meats offer a dense array of bioavailable nutrients—hemin iron, vitamin B12, A, D, and K2—absent or less bioavailable in plants. These nutrients are essential for maintaining insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular health, and metabolic balance. Conversely, plant foods contain antinutrients like oxalates, lectins, and phytates that can impair mineral absorption, provoke systemic inflammation, and potentially contribute to insulin resistance. The concept of fiber as a necessary dietary component lacks evolutionary support; humans did not evolve to depend on fiber for gut health. Instead, they thrived on nutrient-dense animal foods that promote satiety and stable blood sugar levels. The Carnivore elimination protocol eliminates many processed and plant-based foods, reducing inflammatory triggers. This approach supports the body’s natural physiology, minimizes exposure to plant toxins, and leverages the high bioavailability of animal nutrients to manage prediabetes and heart health effectively.\n",
